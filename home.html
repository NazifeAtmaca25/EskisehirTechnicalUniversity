        <h4>Correcting Errors Related to Course Selection</h4>
        <p class="duyuru-icerik"> 
          Eskişehir Technical University Associate and Undergraduate Education and Examination Regulation "ARTICLE 10 - (1) The student renews his registration at the beginning of each semester according to the principles determined by the University Board of Directors."
          
          Eskişehir Technical University Academic Advisory Directive “ARTICLE 6 – Opinions and feedback of the academic advisor during registration renewal, education process and graduation phase; It is a recommendation provided that it complies with the relevant legislation. "The student's choices and practices regarding the education and training processes are his/her own responsibility, provided that they do not contradict the relevant legislation."
          
          Eskişehir Technical University Associate and Undergraduate Education and Examination Regulation "ARTICLE 19 - (5) A student who has a letter grade of FF, YZ or DZ from compulsory courses must take these courses again in the period shown in the course plan, starting from the lowest semester. The student himself/herself "A student who receives one of the letter grades FF, YZ or DZ from an elective course may, if he/she wishes, take a course offered outside the term. The student may repeat this course or take another elective course instead with the approval of his/her advisor."
          
          Eskişehir Technical University Associate and Undergraduate Education and Examination Regulation "ARTICLE 19 - (6) An academic inadequacy warning is given to the student who cannot achieve a 2.00 GPA at the end of the fall or spring semester. The student who receives an academic inadequacy warning will be given an academic inadequacy warning in the summer school or in the following semester. If the student raises his / her score to 2.00, the academic inadequacy warning will be removed. However, the student in this case must retake the courses with letter grades FF, YZ and DZ in the fall and spring semesters. A student who receives a warning and cannot raise his GPA to 2.00 in the following semester must repeat the courses with letter grades FF, YZ and DZ in the next semester, as well as the courses with letter grades below CC starting from the period in which he received an academic inadequacy warning. If the student achieves a GPA of 2.00 at the end of the repeated semester, repeating the course ends.
          
          In this context, the course selections of students who choose courses contrary to the regulations are corrected by the unit student affairs.</p>
